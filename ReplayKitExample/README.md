# Twilio Video ReplayKit Example

The project demonstrates how to integrate Twilio's Programmable Video SDK with `ReplayKit.framework`. Two distinct use cases are covered:

**Conferencing (In-App)**

Use an `RPScreenRecorder` to capture the screen and play/record audio using `TVIDefaultAudioDevice`. After joining a Room you will be able to hear other Participants, and they will be able to hear you, and see the contents of your screen.

When using the in-process `RPScreenRecorder` APIs, you may only capture content from your own application. Screen capture is suspended upon entering the backround. Once you being capturing, your application is locked to its current interface orientation.

**Broadcast (Extension)**

Use an `RPBroadcastSampleHandler` to receive audio and video samples. Video samples are routed to `ReplayKitVideoSource`, while `ExampleReplayKitAudioCapturer` handles audio.

An iOS 12.0 extension is not limited to capturing the screen of a single application. In fact, it is possible to capture video from any application including the home screen.

In order to reduce memory usage, the extension configures `ReplayKitVideoSource` to downscsale incoming video frames, and prefers the H.264 video codec. In a Group Room, the extension connects as a publish-only Participant ([TVIConnectOptionsBuilder.automaticSubscriptionEnabled](https://twilio.github.io/twilio-video-ios/docs/latest/Classes/TVIConnectOptionsBuilder.html#//api/name/automaticSubscriptionEnabled)) to further reduce bandwidth, memory, and CPU requirements.

**ReplayKitVideoSource**

This `TVIVideoSource` produces `TVIVideoFrame`s from `CMSampleBuffer`s captured by ReplayKit. In order to reduce memory usage, this class may be configured (via a format request) to downscale the captured content.

**ExampleReplayKitAudioCapturer**

Audio capture in an extension is handled by `ExampleReplayKitAudioCapturer`, which consumes either application or microphone audio samples delivered by ReplayKit. Unfortunately, since we can't operate an Audio Unit graph in an extension, playback is not allowed.

### Setup

See the master [README](https://github.com/twilio/video-quickstart-swift/blob/master/README.md) for instructions on how to generate access tokens and connect to a Room.

You will need to provide a hardcoded token, or token server URL in [ViewController.swift](ReplayKitExample/ViewController.swift) for conferencing and in [SampleHandler.swift](BroadcastExtension/SampleHandler.swift) for the broadcast extension.

This example requires Xcode 10.0 and the iOS 12.0 SDK, as well as a device running iOS 11.0 or above. While the app launches on an iPhone Simulator, ReplayKit is non-functional.

### Running

Once you have setup your access token, install and run the example. You will be presented with the following screen:

**iOS 12**

**iOS 11**

<kbd><img width="360px" src="../images/quickstart/replaykit-launch-ios11.png"/></kbd>

From here you can tap "Start Broadcast" to begin using the broadcast extension. The extension will automatically join a room called "Broadcast", unless a Room is specified in your access token grants. Other participants can join using the QuickStart example, or any other example app which can display remote video.

Tapping "Start Conference" begins capturing and sharing the screen from within the main application. Please note that backgrounding the app during a conference will cause in-app capture to be suspended.

### Betterments

1. Support capturing both application and microphone audio at the same time, in an extension. Down-mix the resulting audio samples into a single stream.
2. Share the camera using ReplayKit, or `TVICameraSource`.
3. Resolve tearing issues when scrolling vertically, and image corruption when sharing video. (ISDK-2478)
4. Quantize ReplayKit video timestamps and use them to drop from 60 / 120 fps peaks to a lower rate (15 / 30).

### Known Issues

**1. Memory Usage**

The memory usage of a ReplayKit Broadcast Extension is limited to 50 MB (as of iOS 12.2). There are cases where Twilio Video can use more than this amount, especially when capturing larger 2x and 3x retina screens in a Peer-to-Peer Room. This example uses format requests, and H.264 to reduce the amount of memory needed by the extension.

It is highly recommended that you use Group Rooms with your ReplayKit extension, because the extension may connect without subscribing to Tracks.

**2. Application Audio Delay**

An `RPSampleHandler` may receive both application and microphone audio samples. We have found that, while microphone samples are suitable for realtime usage, application audio samples are significantly delayed.

The following table shows what you can expect in the field (mesaured on iOS 12.1.3, and an iPhone X).

| Sample Type | Format                          | Sample Size (Frames) | Period (milliseconds) |
|-------------|---------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| Application | 1ch, 44,100 Hz, Big Endian    | 22,596               | 512.3                 |
| Microphone  | 1ch, 44,100 Hz, Little Endian | 1,024                | 23.2                  |

**3. Application Audio & Copy Protection**

It is not possible to capture application audio produced by AVPlayer, by Safari video playback (even if no Fairplay DRM is used), or by the Music app.

**4. RPScreenRecorder Debugging**

It is possible to get ReplayKit into an inconsistent state when setting breakpoints in `RPScreenRecorder` callbacks. If you notice that capture is starting but no audio/video samples are being produced, then you should reset Media Services on your device.

First, end your debugging session and then navigate to: 

**Settings > Developer > Reset Media Services**

<kbd><img width="400px" src="../images/quickstart/replaykit-reset-media-services.png"/></kbd>

**5. Extension Debugging**

It is possible to get ReplayKit into an inconsistent state when debugging `RPBroadcastSampleHandler` callbacks. If this occurs you may notice the following error:

> Broadcast did finish with error: Error Domain=com.apple.ReplayKit.RPRecordingErrorDomain Code=-5808 "Attempted to start an invalid broadcast session" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=Attempted to start an invalid broadcast session}

This problem may be solved by deleting and re-installing the example app.

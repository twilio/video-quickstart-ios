## Setup 

### Twilio Library Setup for the Project

You will need to add the Twilio Video library to the project to compile and run. You can do this using the [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) dependency management system. 

#### Using Cocoapods

First, you will need to have Cocoapods 1.0.0+ installed on your Mac, so go ahead and do that if you haven't already - the directions are here: [Getting Started with Cocoapods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html). If you're not sure, type `pod --version` into a command line.

Next, just run `pod install` from the command line in the top level directory of this project. Cocoapods will install the Twilio library and then set up a .xcworkspace file that you will use to run your project from now on.

**Note: If you've used [Twilio's Cocoapods Spec Repo](https://github.com/twilio/cocoapod-specs) before you may need to update it by running `pod repo update twilio` before installing dependencies.** 

#### Using a Simulator

You can use the iOS Simulator that comes with Xcode to do your testing, but local video will not be shared since the Simulator cannot access a camera. 

**Note:If you have an iOS device, you can now run apps from Xcode on your device without a paid developer account.**


#### Prerequisites

This project uses Apple's Swift programming language 3.0 for iOS, and the only supported way to develop iOS apps is on an Apple computer running OS X and Xcode. We have tested this application with the latest versions of iOS (10.3) and Xcode (8.3) at the time of this writing. 

**Note: If you haven't used Twilio before, welcome! You'll need to [Sign up for a Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) first. It's free!**


#### About the Quickstart Project

This project consists of two sample apps: one using CallKit, and one without CallKit support.

The quickstarts will help you integrate Twilio Video directly into your iOS applications using Twilio's Video SDK. These examples are for Swift developers.

**Note: if your app uses Objective-C see [video-quickstart-objective-c](https://github.com/twilio/video-quickstart-objc/).**


Review the code to see how how to set up key classes like `TVIRoom`, `TVIParticipant`, and `TVICameraCapturer`. The ViewController implements the `TVIRoomDelegate`, and `TVIParticipantDelegate` protocols in order to display remote Participant video on screen.

Download this project and run `pod install` to install TwilioVideo.framework. Open VideoQuickStart.xcworkspace in Xcode.



## Quickstart



### Running the Quickstart

To get started with the Quickstart application follow these steps:

1. Open this project in XCode

<img width="700px" src="images/quickstart/xcode-video-quickstart.png"/>

2. Next, you need to generate a valid Access Token. Log in to the Twilio Console and go to the [Testing Tools page](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/video/dev-tools/testing-tools) shown below. Pick a name for your user identity (such as "Alice"), type it in the identity textbox and click "Generate Access Token". Copy the Access Token string that will appear in the gray box - we will need in the following step.


<img width="700px" src="images/quickstart/generate_access_tokens.png"/>

*Note: If you enter the Room Name, then you can retrict this user's access to the specified Room only. Ideally, you want to implement and deploy an Access Token server to generate tokens. You can read more about setting up your own Access Token Server in this [section](#setup-an-access-token-server). Read this [tutorial](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/video/user-identity-access-tokens) to learn more about Access Tokens.*

3. Paste the token you generated in the earlier step in the `ViewController.swift`.

<img width="700px" src="images/quickstart/xcode-video-quickstart-token.png"/>


4. Run the Quickstart app on your iOS device or iOS Simulator. 

<img width="500px" src="images/emulator/emulator-iOS-video-quickstart.png"/>

5. As in Step 2, generate a new Token for another identity (such as "Bob"). Copy and paste the access token into `ViewController.swift` (replacing the one you used earlier). Build and run the app on a second physical device if you have one, or the iPhone simulator.

6. Once you have both apps running, enter an identical Room name (such as "MyRoom") into both apps, and tap "Connect" to connect to a video Room (you'll be prompted for mic and camera access on the physical device). Once you've connected from both devices, you should see video! (Since the iPhone Simulator doesn't have a camera you'll only see video in one direction if you're using that environment.)



## Examples

You will also find additional examples that provide more advanced use cases of the Video SDK. The currently included examples are as follows:

- [Screen Capturer](ScreenCapturerExample) - Shows how to use `TVIScreenCapturer` to capture the contents of a `UIView`, and how a custom `TVIVideoCapturer` can be implemented to do the same.
- [Video CallKit](VideoCallKitExample) - Shows how to use Twilio Video with the iOS CallKit framework.



## Setup an Access Token Server

Using Twilio's Video client within your applications requires an access token. Access Tokens are short-lived credentials that are signed with a Twilio API Key Secret and contain grants which govern the actions the client holding the token is permitted to perform. 

### Configuring the Access Token Server

If you want to be a little closer to a real environment, you can download one of the video quickstart server applications - for instance, [Video Quickstart: PHP](https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/video-quickstart-php) and either run it locally, or install it on a server. You can review a detailed [tutorial](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/video/user-identity-access-tokens#generating-access-tokens). 

You'll need to gather a couple of configuration options from the Twilio developer console before running it, so read the directions on the quickstart. You'll copy the config.example.php file to a config.php file, and then add in these credentials:
 
 Credential | Description
---------- | -----------
Twilio Account SID | Your main Twilio account identifier - [find it on your dashboard](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/video).
API Key | Used to authenticate - [generate one here](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/messaging/dev-tools/api-keys).
API Secret | Used to authenticate - [just like the above, you'll get one here](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/messaging/dev-tools/api-keys).


### Generating an Access Token in the Twilio Video Console

If you don't want to setup an Access Token Server just yet and want to test out the Quickstart Application, then you can choose to generate your Access Tokens in the [Twilio Video Console](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/video/dev-tools/testing-tools). 


<img width="700px" src="images/quickstart/generate_access_tokens.png"/>

Use whatever clever username you would like for the identity. If you enter the Room Name, then you can retrict this users access to the specified Room only. Read this [tutorial](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/video/user-identity-access-tokens) for more information on Access Tokens. 

#### A Note on API Keys

When you generate an API key pair at the URLs above, your API Secret will only
be shown once - make sure to save this in a secure location.

#### Running the Video Quickstart with ngrok

Because we suggest that you run your video chat application on actual iOS device so that you can use the camera on the device, you'll need to provide an externally accessible URL for the app (the iOS simulator will be fine with localhost). [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)  creates a publicly accessible URL that you can use to send HTTP/HTTPS traffic to a server running on your localhost. Use HTTPS to make web connections that retrieve a Twilio access token.

When you get a URL from ngrok, go ahead and update ViewController.swift with the new URL.  If you go down this path, be sure to follow the directions in the comments in the viewDidLoad() method at the top of the source file - you will need to uncomment one line, and comment out another. You will also need to update the code if your ngrok URL changes.

For this quick start, the Application transport security settings are set to allow arbitrary HTTP loads for testing your app. For production applications, you'll definitely want to retrieve access tokens over HTTPS/SSL.

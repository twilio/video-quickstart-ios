# Twilio Video Quick Start for Swift

> NOTE: This application uses Twilio's new Programmable Video Rooms API, which is currently available in Beta. The docs are [here](https://media.twiliocdn.com/sdk/ios/video/v1.0/docs/).

## Up and Running

To get started, we'll make a 1:1 video call between the iPhone simulator in XCode and your own iOS device.

1) Download this project and run `pod install` to install TwilioVideo.framework. Open VideoQuickStart.xcworkspace in Xcode.

2) Create a Twilio Video [Configuration Profile](https://www.twilio.com/console/video/profiles) in the Twilio Console. If you haven't used Twilio before, welcome! You'll need to [Sign up for a Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio). It's free!

3) Generate an [Access Token](https://www.twilio.com/console/video/dev-tools/testing-tools) in the Twilio Console. Pick a name for your user identity (such as "Alice"). Leave this web page open, because you'll use it as the other side of the video chat.

4) Copy and paste the access token into ViewController.swift.

5) Build and run the app on a physical device (iPhone, iPod Touch, etc.)

6) On the same web page where you generated the token, generate another Access Token for another identity (such as "Bob")

7) Copy and paste the access token into ViewController.swift (replacing the one you used earlier).

8) Build and run the app on a second physical device if you have one, or the iPhone simulator.

9) Once you have both apps running, enter an identical Room name (such as "MyRoom") into both apps, and tap "Connect" to connect to a video Room (you'll be prompted for mic and camera access on the physical device). Once you've connected from both devices, you should see video! (Since the iPhone Simulator doesn't have a camera you'll only see video in one direction if you're using that environment.)

## What is this project?

This project consists of two sample apps: one using CallKit, and one without CallKit support.

The quick starts will help you get video chat integrated directly into your iOS applications using Twilio's Video SDK. These examples are for Swift developers - if your app uses Objective-C see [video-quickstart-objective-c](https://github.com/twilio/video-quickstart-objc/).

The sample apps are written in Swift 3.0. You will need at least Xcode 8.0 in order to run the applications.

Review the code to see how how to set up key classes like `TVIVideoClient`, `TVIRoom`, `TVIParticipant`, `TVILocalMedia`, and `TVICameraCapturer`. The ViewController implements the `TVIRoomDelegate`, and `TVIParticipantDelegate` protocols in order to display remote Participant video on screen.

### Additional Examples

You will also find additional examples that provide more advanced use cases of the Video SDK. The currently included examples are as follows:

- [Screen Capturer](ScreenCapturerExample) - Shows how to use `TVIScreenCapturer` to capture the contents of a `UIView`, and how a custom `TVIVideoCapturer` can be implemented to do the same.

## Prerequisites

This project uses Apple's Swift programming language 3.0 for iOS, and the only supported way to develop iOS apps is on an Apple computer running OS X and Xcode. We have tested this application with the latest versions of iOS (10.0) and Xcode (8.0) at the time of this writing.

You can use the iOS Simulator that comes with Xcode to do your testing, but local video will not be shared since the Simulator cannot access a camera. If you have an iOS device, you can now run apps from Xcode on your device without a paid developer account.

## Twilio Library Setup for the Project

You will need to add the Twilio Video library to the project to compile and run. You can do this using the [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) dependency management system. Version 1.0 or greater is required.

### Using Cocoapods

First, you will need to have Cocoapods 1.0.0+ installed on your Mac, so go ahead and do that if you haven't already - the directions are here: [Getting Started with Cocoapods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html). If you're not sure, type `pod --version` into a command line.

Next, just run `pod install` from the command line in the top level directory of this project. Cocoapods will install the Twilio library and then set up a .xcworkspace file that you will use to run your project from now on.

> NOTE: If you've used [Twilio's Cocoapods Spec Repo](https://github.com/twilio/cocoapod-specs) before you may need to update it by running `pod repo update twilio` before installing dependencies.

## Access Tokens and Servers

Using Twilio's Video client within your applications requires an access token. These access tokens can come from one of two places:

1) You can create a one-time use access token for testing in the [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console/video/profiles). This access token can be hard-coded directly into your mobile app, and you won't need to run your own server. This works for local development and testing, but isn't a solution for a production environment.

2) When you're ready to take the next step, you can run your own server that provides access tokens using your Twilio credentials. This server can either run locally on your development machine, or it can be installed on a server. If you run the server on your local machine, you can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to give the server an externally accessible web address. That way, you can run the quick start app on an actual device, instead of the iOS Simulator.

### Generating an Access Token

The first step is to [Generate an Access Token](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/video/dev-tools/testing-tools) from the Twilio developer console. Use whatever clever username you would like for the identity. You will get an access token that you can copy and paste into ViewController.swift.

### Setting up a Video Chat Web Server

If you want to be a little closer to a real environment, you can download one of the video quickstart applications - for instance, [Video Quickstart: PHP](https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/video-quickstart-php) and either run it locally, or install it on a server.

 You'll need to gather a couple of configuration options from your Twilio developer console before running it, so read the directions on the quickstart. You'll copy the config.example.php file to a config.php file, and then add in these credentials:
 
 Credential | Description
---------- | -----------
Twilio Account SID | Your main Twilio account identifier - [find it on your dashboard](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/video).
Twilio Video Configuration SID | Adds video capability to the access token - [generate one here](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/video/profiles)
API Key | Used to authenticate - [generate one here](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/messaging/dev-tools/api-keys).
API Secret | Used to authenticate - [just like the above, you'll get one here](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/messaging/dev-tools/api-keys).

#### A Note on API Keys

When you generate an API key pair at the URLs above, your API Secret will only
be shown once - make sure to save this in a secure location.

#### Running the Video Quickstart with ngrok

Because we suggest that you run your video chat application on actual iOS device so that you can use the camera on the device, you'll need to provide an externally accessible URL for the app (the iOS simulator will be fine with localhost). [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)  creates a publicly accessible URL that you can use to send HTTP/HTTPS traffic to a server running on your localhost. Use HTTPS to make web connections that retrieve a Twilio access token.

When you get a URL from ngrok, go ahead and update ViewController.swift with the new URL.  If you go down this path, be sure to follow the directions in the comments in the viewDidLoad() method at the top of the source file - you will need to uncomment one line, and comment out another. You will also need to update the code if your ngrok URL changes.

For this quick start, the Application transport security settings are set to allow arbitrary HTTP loads for testing your app. For production applications, you'll definitely want to retrieve access tokens over HTTPS/SSL.

## Have fun!

This is an introduction to Twilio's Video SDK on iOS. From here, you can start building applications that use video chat across the web, iOS, and Android platforms.
